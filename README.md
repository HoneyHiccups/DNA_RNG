# DNA_RNG

/*
This is a simple dna geny. It is using random numbers to create encoded dna and then store the vaules in a double linked list. It has a much more efffective way of storing the dna vaules then just char vars.

Planned Things to add, function markers to detect diffreant things that the dna is making
A parrale linked list to help with climbing and decending the linked list and stroring artifacts that the dna has created. In addation I plan on making it catch the rtifacts that it has created.

Added seeds so that the rng can be seed based, I think this will be intreasting to see how many artifacts are produced that match dna that has be cataloged for other anamials.

Files streaming to stream in and stream out dna and artifacts.

Memmory alloc, to set the amount of dna and memorry that the user would like

Some bugs-> I had to wrap my functions in a struct in a fucntion header else it could not resovle the function call, no idea why I plan on fixing that soon but its really far out.
